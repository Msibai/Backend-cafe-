The Backend Cafe
 As our project title shows, we tried to build a cafe website for the programmers who love to enjoy their coffee while coding in our Backend Cafe. 
 The purpose of this website is only educational and is built in order to complete the group assignment for the course. We have 3 types of logins in the website,
 i.e A customer : who can log in , check the menu items and place an order at our website , A restaurant worker : who can log in and see the orders received by the Cafe
& An Admin : who can log in and edit/delete the cafe's menu items.
